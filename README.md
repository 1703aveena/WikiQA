# Repo for Q-A and Answer triggering systems
This repository contains experiments on the [WikiQA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/wikiqa-a-challenge-dataset-for-open-domain-question-answering/) dataset
mainly for investigating answer triggering.

The current CNN implementation is from [Deep learning for answer sentence selection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1632.pdf).
The dataset is read from data/ folder and currently hardcoded in the last-line of the text.
Uses keras for CNN.
